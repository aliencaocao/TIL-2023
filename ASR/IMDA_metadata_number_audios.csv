/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1234.wav,TRANSACTION THEN IT WILL DEDUCT DIRECTLY FROM THE TEN K YEN
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1236.wav,ELEVEN K TWELVE K THIRTEEN K FOURTEEN K FIFTEEN K

/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1272.wav,WHICH REQUIRES FIVE K POINTS
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1273.wav,IF IM NOT WRONG OR OR OR TEN K POINTS FOR TWENTY K MILES BECAUSE THATS THATS THATS THE RATE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1274.wav,SO IM NOT SURE WHICH IS THE MINIMUM BUT AND THEN THERES A I DONT THINK ITS TEN THOUSANDS I THINK ITS TWENTY FIVE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1288.wav,UM SO I THINK ONCE YOU SIGN UP I THINK BY TWENTY SEVEN IS IT TWENTY SEVEN
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1289.wav,ERR I THINK ONCE YOU SIGN UP YOULL GET FIVE DOLLARS
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1291.wav,THEN YOULL HAVE TO TRY TO HIT THE FIVE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS LOR
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1292.wav,HUH SO TH THAT MEANS YOU DONT GET THE ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AT ALL
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1294.wav,I GUESS IS BETTER FOR FAMILIES LAH BECAUSE FAMILIES FIVE HUNDRED I THINK ITS ITS ALMOST
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-130.wav,ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1301.wav,HALFWAY WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK ONE LAH HAVE TO GO AND PEE HAVE TO GO AND

/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1363.wav,THEN AFTER THAT IT WENT UP A LOT HIGHER SIAN IF NOT I COULD HAVE MADE LIKE SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1364.wav,I HAD SIX OPEN TRADES I SOLD TWO
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3046-1366.wav,THEN NOW I HAVE FOUR MORE LEFT LAH FOUR MORE

/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2279.wav,IM WORKING IN ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT DOES THE FOOD DELIVERY THE REASON IM LIKING IT IS ITS GIVING ME SOME PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO EXERCISE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2282.wav,DID YOU DID YOU SEE THE VIDEO OF THE TWO PEOPLE BOXING EACH OTHER IN THE TRAIN
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2284.wav,TWO PEOPLE FIGHTING INSIDE THE TRAIN BOXING EACH OTHER

/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2287.wav,THE TRAIN SOMEONE SOMEONE PRESSED THE EMERGENCY BUTTON TO STOP THE TRAIN
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2288.wav,I MEAN THAT IS ONE THING BUT I WOULD I WOULD ACTUALLY BE SCARED THAT I MEAN FOR ME IN THE SINGAPORE TRAINS I AM A BIT HAPPY
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-229.wav,FOR THESE TWO PEOPLE WHOM YOU EARLIER SAID WERE BULLYING DO YOU SEE A SCOREBOARD BESIDE BOTH OF THEM
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2294.wav,USUALLY THE ONE THING THAT DISTURBS ME A LITTLE BIT IS WHEN I SEE THE CIGARETTE BUTTS THAT ARE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-230.wav,A SCOREBOARD ONE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ROLLING THE BALL IS SUE THE OTHER ONE IS BEN DO YOU SEE THAT

/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2326.wav,SO I CAME UH STARTED STUDYING IN SINGAPORE AT AGE THIRTEEN
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2327.wav,SECONDARY I WAS STUDYING ALONE BUT I WAS STAYING ALONE STUDYING STARTED STUDYING
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-233.wav,OKAY THEY ARE CLO THEY HAVE CLOTHES ON THE CLOTHES LINE TWO OF THEM TWO PEGS HAVE FALLING OFF
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2332.wav,SO ITS ONLY MAINLY ONE MEAL I HAVE TO TAKE CARE FOR MYSELF
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2335.wav,THEN MY FOOD MY FATHER USED TO GIVE ME POCKET MONEY
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2337.wav,TILL EIGHTEEN TILL LIKE TILL LIKE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2345.wav,SO ONE OF THE SUITABLE SCHOOL HE WENT TO WAS THE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL SYSTEM
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2348.wav,BECAUSE THE SCHOOL PRICE IS ALMOST TEN TIMES THE COST OF A NORMAL SCHOOL
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-235.wav,YEP I HAVE THAT TOO DO YOU SEE YOU KNOW THE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE THOWING WHO ARE BALL THOWING THE BALL TO ITS BOWLING PIN RIGHT
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2361.wav,BUT I THINK ONE THING ABOUT THIS COMPANY HEADS AH THEY ACTUALLY THEY HAVE SUCH A LARGE PUBLIC PERSONALITY AFTER THE COMPANY BECOMES SOMETHING
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-237.wav,NO NO NO NOT THE ONE THROWING THE BALL DO YOU SEE ITS SOMEONE WITH A OBJECT IN THEIR MONTH
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2375.wav,BUT NOW AT MY AGE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED UH ACTUALLY ALREADY
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2382.wav,AND HES FINANCIALLY HIS PARENTS WERE MILLIONAIRES IF IM NOT WRONG
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2387.wav,OR IM USING TO USING MY MOBILE PHONE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2391.wav,FOR EXAMPLE I STAYED UP LATE ONE OR TWO DAYS UH WHICH I WAS THEN WHEN I WOKE UP I DIDNT FEEL LIKE GETTING UP I MISSED ONE CLASS
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2393.wav,NO NO NO IF MY HAVE TO BE MORE ACCURATE BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET THREE OUT A PASS THIS UNIT AND GET THROUGH IT
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2398.wav,SO EVEN TO ACCOMMODATE A TENANT THERES A LOT OF MOVING AND SHIFTING AND REARRANGEMENT OF FURNITURE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2403.wav,WE WERE PLANNING TO MOVE INTO A FIVE ROOM FLAT SO WE HAD BOUGHT FURNITURE FOR FIVE ROOM FLAT THE FURNITURE WAS NOT PURCHASED FOR A THREE ROOM FLAT
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2406.wav,THE FURNITURE FOR THE FLAT INTENDING TO MOVE IN TO A LARGER FLAT
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2407.wav,SO HE PURCHASED IT FOR A FIVE ROOM PROPERTY HE DIDNT PURCHASE IT FOR A THREE ROOM
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2408.wav,SO HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO FORK OUT ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE WHEN HE MOVES TO A FIVE ROOM FLAT
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2410.wav,UH HE NEEDED TO TOP UP I THINK ABOUT HUNDRED SE MORE MORE THAN HUNDRED NOT HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED OVER THOUSAND FOR THE FLAT
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2412.wav,UH I CAN PUR UH AS A SINGLE CAN PURCHASE AT AGE THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2413.wav,SO THEN IM LOOKING AT A TWO ROOM FLEXI I THINK
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2421.wav,SO FAR TOTALLY IVE ONLY GOT TWENTY FIVE ORDERS
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2425.wav,FOR WALK FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER PLACE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-243.wav,BUT IN MY PICTURE IS JUMPING ITS ALMOST IN EVERY SIX STOP THAT WOULD SURE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2434.wav,HE WOULD ONE PERSON INTRODUCE ME TO IT THEN AFTER THAT I TOOK IT OUT
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2439.wav,MM NEAR TWO UH TWO CLASSES PER MOD IM DOING TWO MODULES FOUR CLASSES A WEEK
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-244.wav,THE ONLY WAY A BEE COULD HAVE GOTTEN TO THE HIVE MAKE SURE THE GAPS
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2447.wav,LIKE WHEN HE SAW THE BILL RIGHT WAIT I SHOW YOU THE ONE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2452.wav,THE ONLY THING I ON IS THE FAN I ON THE FAN AND I USE MY MY PHONE CHARGER IS ON
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2456.wav,CAUSE THEY NO ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES AT ALL ONE IN THE HOUSE ITS ONLY THE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2459.wav,AT PRESENT CANNOT RENT OUT CAUSE I USE ONE ROOM MY MY FATHER USES HE USES THE OTHER ROOM
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2464.wav,SO THIS GIVE ME THE GIVE ME THE POCKET MONEY TO EARN HERE AND THERE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2467.wav,BECAUSE I HEARD THE SOME GOT MAINTENANCE PROBLEM SOME UH THIS THAT BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE SOMETHING WITH YOU YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
/mnt/d/IMDA_TIL/audio_part3/3220-2468.wav,IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN BUY THE THING IS WHETHER YOU CAN TAKE CARE AND MAINTENANCE
