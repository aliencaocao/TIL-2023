audio_part3/3046-126.wav,THERE ARE THREE CONDIMENTS ON THE TABLE

audio_part3/3046-1288.wav,UM SO I THINK ONCE YOU SIGN UP I THINK BY TWENTY SEVEN IS IT TWENTY SEVEN
audio_part3/3046-1289.wav,ERR I THINK ONCE YOU SIGN UP YOULL GET FIVE DOLLARS
audio_part3/3046-1291.wav,THEN YOULL HAVE TO TRY TO HIT THE FIVE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS LOR

audio_part3/3220-2272.wav,UH SO THAT MY LICENSE NOW ONCE ITS GOT AND DONE I DONT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
audio_part3/3220-2279.wav,IM WORKING IN ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT DOES THE FOOD DELIVERY THE REASON IM LIKING IT IS ITS GIVING ME SOME PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO EXERCISE
audio_part3/3220-2282.wav,DID YOU DID YOU SEE THE VIDEO OF THE TWO PEOPLE BOXING EACH OTHER IN THE TRAIN
audio_part3/3220-2284.wav,TWO PEOPLE FIGHTING INSIDE THE TRAIN BOXING EACH OTHER

audio_part3/3220-2287.wav,THE TRAIN SOMEONE SOMEONE PRESSED THE EMERGENCY BUTTON TO STOP THE TRAIN
audio_part3/3220-2288.wav,I MEAN THAT IS ONE THING BUT I WOULD I WOULD ACTUALLY BE SCARED THAT I MEAN FOR ME IN THE SINGAPORE TRAINS I AM A BIT HAPPY
audio_part3/3220-229.wav,FOR THESE TWO PEOPLE WHOM YOU EARLIER SAID WERE BULLYING DO YOU SEE A SCOREBOARD BESIDE BOTH OF THEM
audio_part3/3220-2294.wav,USUALLY THE ONE THING THAT DISTURBS ME A LITTLE BIT IS WHEN I SEE THE CIGARETTE BUTTS THAT ARE
audio_part3/3220-230.wav,A SCOREBOARD ONE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ROLLING THE BALL IS SUE THE OTHER ONE IS BEN DO YOU SEE THAT
audio_part3/3220-2308.wav,I WANT CHILDREN I DID TOLD YOU RIGHT NO I MEAN YOUR OWN PARENT YOUR PARENTS GENERATION TO YOUR GENERATION I TOLD YOU MAN WHEN I FOURTEEN YEARS OLD DADS PASSED AWAY RIGHT
audio_part3/3220-2326.wav,SO I CAME UH STARTED STUDYING IN SINGAPORE AT AGE THIRTEEN
audio_part3/3220-2327.wav,SECONDARY I WAS STUDYING ALONE BUT I WAS STAYING ALONE STUDYING STARTED STUDYING
audio_part3/3220-233.wav,OKAY THEY ARE CLO THEY HAVE CLOTHES ON THE CLOTHES LINE TWO OF THEM TWO PEGS HAVE FALLING OFF
audio_part3/3220-2332.wav,SO ITS ONLY MAINLY ONE MEAL I HAVE TO TAKE CARE FOR MYSELF
audio_part3/3220-2335.wav,THEN MY FOOD MY FATHER USED TO GIVE ME POCKET MONEY
audio_part3/3220-2337.wav,TILL EIGHTEEN TILL LIKE TILL LIKE
audio_part3/3220-2345.wav,SO ONE OF THE SUITABLE SCHOOL HE WENT TO WAS THE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL SYSTEM
audio_part3/3220-2348.wav,BECAUSE THE SCHOOL PRICE IS ALMOST TEN TIMES THE COST OF A NORMAL SCHOOL
audio_part3/3220-235.wav,YEP I HAVE THAT TOO DO YOU SEE YOU KNOW THE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE THOWING WHO ARE BALL THOWING THE BALL TO ITS BOWLING PIN RIGHT
audio_part3/3220-2361.wav,BUT I THINK ONE THING ABOUT THIS COMPANY HEADS AH THEY ACTUALLY THEY HAVE SUCH A LARGE PUBLIC PERSONALITY AFTER THE COMPANY BECOMES SOMETHING
audio_part3/3220-237.wav,NO NO NO NOT THE ONE THROWING THE BALL DO YOU SEE ITS SOMEONE WITH A OBJECT IN THEIR MONTH
audio_part3/3220-2375.wav,BUT NOW AT MY AGE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED UH ACTUALLY ALREADY
audio_part3/3220-2382.wav,AND HES FINANCIALLY HIS PARENTS WERE MILLIONAIRES IF IM NOT WRONG
audio_part3/3220-2387.wav,OR IM USING TO USING MY MOBILE PHONE
audio_part3/3220-2391.wav,FOR EXAMPLE I STAYED UP LATE ONE OR TWO DAYS UH WHICH I WAS THEN WHEN I WOKE UP I DIDNT FEEL LIKE GETTING UP I MISSED ONE CLASS
audio_part3/3220-2393.wav,NO NO NO IF MY HAVE TO BE MORE ACCURATE BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET THREE OUT A PASS THIS UNIT AND GET THROUGH IT
audio_part3/3220-2398.wav,SO EVEN TO ACCOMMODATE A TENANT THERES A LOT OF MOVING AND SHIFTING AND REARRANGEMENT OF FURNITURE
audio_part3/3220-2403.wav,WE WERE PLANNING TO MOVE INTO A FIVE ROOM FLAT SO WE HAD BOUGHT FURNITURE FOR FIVE ROOM FLAT THE FURNITURE WAS NOT PURCHASED FOR A THREE ROOM FLAT
audio_part3/3220-2406.wav,THE FURNITURE FOR THE FLAT INTENDING TO MOVE IN TO A LARGER FLAT
audio_part3/3220-2407.wav,SO HE PURCHASED IT FOR A FIVE ROOM PROPERTY HE DIDNT PURCHASE IT FOR A THREE ROOM
audio_part3/3220-2408.wav,SO HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO FORK OUT ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE WHEN HE MOVES TO A FIVE ROOM FLAT
audio_part3/3220-2410.wav,UH HE NEEDED TO TOP UP I THINK ABOUT HUNDRED SE MORE MORE THAN HUNDRED NOT HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED OVER THOUSAND FOR THE FLAT
audio_part3/3220-2412.wav,UH I CAN PUR UH AS A SINGLE CAN PURCHASE AT AGE THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE
audio_part3/3220-2413.wav,SO THEN IM LOOKING AT A TWO ROOM FLEXI I THINK

audio_part3/3220-2464.wav,SO THIS GIVE ME THE GIVE ME THE POCKET MONEY TO EARN HERE AND THERE
