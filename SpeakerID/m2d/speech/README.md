# Masked Modeling Duo for Speech (M2D-S)

This repository *will shortly* offer implementation of our paper "Masked Modeling Duo for Speech: Specializing General-Purpose Audio Representation to Speech using Denoising Distillation".

We hope our code to help further audio representation and application studies in the future. Thank you!
